#Task: Write the function to get a dataset from Base R: Titanic
titanic <- read.csv('C:/Users/ragha/Documents/syllabus/ANA_505/week_4/titanic.csv')


#and give the dataframe a new name of your choice
#(hint: you will want your data to be a dataframe. Use the function: as.data.frame(Titanic))
new_titanic <- data.frame(titanic)

#See the top rows of the data
#TASK: Write the function to see the top rows of the data
head(new_titanic)

#Let's just see the Survived and Sex columns
#Task: Write the function to 'select' the Survived and Sex columns
#(hint: use the 'select' function)
modify_titanic <- select(new_titanic,Survived,Sex)

#Let's name the dataset with just the two columns, Survived and Sex
#TASK: Write the function to save the two columns as one new dataset
#and give it a name
saveRDS(modify_titanic, file = "df_newdata.RDS")
df_save<- readRDS("df_newdata.RDS")

#Let's get rid of the Sex column in the new dataset created above
#TASK: Write the function that deselects the sex column
#(hint: use the 'select' function to not select a -column)
remove_data <- df_save %>% select(-one_of("Sex"))
head(remove_data)

#Let's rename a column name
#TASK: Write the function that renames 'Sex' to 'Gender'

#Let's make a new dataframe with the new column name
#TASK: Write the function that names a new dataset that includes the 'gender' column
gender_df <- data.frame(new_titanic %>% rename("Gender" = "Sex"))

#Let's 'filter' just the males from our dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'male'
male_data <- filter(gender_new , Gender == 'Male')

#Let's 'arrange' our data by gender (not the data you just filtered)
#TASK: Write the function to group the data by gender (hint: arrange())
arrange(gender_new, Gender)

#Let's see how many people were examined in the dataset (total the frequency in the original dataframe)
#TASK: Sum the Freq column
#TASK: After you run it, write the total here:_2201___
sum(new_titanic$Freq)


#Since we have a males dataset, let's make a females dataset
#TASK: Write the function that includes only rows that are 'female'
female_data <- filter(gender_new , Gender == 'Female')

#And now let's join the males and females
#TASK: Write the function that joins the male and female rows
#(hint: try using 'union' or 'bind_rows')
male_female_data <- bind_rows(male_data,female_data)
